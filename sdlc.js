/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "In this second step, the development team will outline design specifications in order to determine the best way to implement their code. The requirements are presented to stakeholders, who will evaluate the risks and costs of the project."
const design = "This third step engages the developers in outlining their solution through visual representations to see how data moves and is manipulated through their code during execution. Extra information is also compiled from user and developer experiences."
const implementation = "The fourth step in the Software Development Lifecycle is when the code is finally written."
const testingAndIntegration = "The fifth step sees the code through many trials and test sets to make sure it is bug-free and runs without runtime or logic errors. The software is deployed afterward."
const maintain = "This sixth and final step has dedicated managers who fix bugs that are discovered as the software is used and ward against deprecation. This step is never finished."
